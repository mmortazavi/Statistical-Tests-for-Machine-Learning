    "## 1. Basic Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Hypothesis testing: Statistical problem which, in regard to a data sample, assumes that an initial hypothesis  H0  is true and check if the evidence against it is sufficiently strong in favor of an alternative hypothesis  H1.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Statistic: Quantitative measure calculated with the tests. This quantitative measure provides the feasibility of the null hypothesis. Each test has its characteristic way of obtaining this value and the statistics follow a particular probability distribution (such as normal distribution, etc.).    \n",
    "   - Confidence Internal (CI): A confidence interval is how much uncertainty there is with any particular statistic. Confidence intervals are often used with a margin of error. It tells you how confident you can be that the results from a poll or survey reflect what you would expect to find if it were possible to survey the entire population. Confidence intervals are intrinsically connected to confidence levels α or Type I error (false positive) (A 0% confidence level means you have no faith at all that if you repeated the survey that you would get the same results. A 100% confidence level means there is no doubt at all that if you repeated the survey you would get the same results). Factors that Affect CI are: Population size, Sample Size, Percentage. Below α is the error quantile.\n",

    "    For a 95% confidence level using normal distribution (α=5%):\n",
    "    ![image.png](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/images/ci95.gif)\n",
    "*Note finding confidence intervals is not only based on the normal distribution. In reality, most confidence intervals are found using the t-distribution (especially if you are working with small samples). <br>\n",
    "*For an example of how it is computed in machine learning for a classification problem see: https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2016/model-evaluation-selection-part1.html or https://machinelearningmastery.com/report-classifier-performance-confidence-intervals/\n",
    "   - p-value: Probability of obtaining a value of the statistic at least as extreme as the obtained in the test. Learn more.\n",
    "   - Rejection of  H0: When the p-value is less than the significance level  α, the test is considered statistically significant and the null hypothesis is rejected."

    "## 2. Parametric vs Non-parametric\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parametric test: \n",
    "Statistical test that makes assumptions about the parameters of the population distribution of the data. These assumptions can be summarize as:\n",
    "- Normality: The distribution of the data follows a gaussian distribution.\n",
    "- Homoscedasticity: This assumption means that the variance around the regression line is the same for all values of the predictor variable.\n",
    "- Independence: the values of a group are independent between them.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Non-parametric test: \n",
    "Statistical test that does not make assumptions about the parameters of the population distribution of the data. Less powerful than its parametric counterpart. Nonparametric tests are sometimes called distribution-free tests because they are based on fewer assumptions"

    "## 3. Normality Tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shapiro-Wilk: Tests the null hypothesis that the samples come from a normally distributed population. This is considered as one of the most powerful tests with unspecified mean and variance, especially for samples of less than 30 elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- D'Agostino-Pearson: Tests the null hypothesis that the samples come from normally distributed population. The test combines the asymmetry coefficient (to what extent the normal is symmetric or of coefficient 0) and the coefficient of Kurtosis (degree of amplitude, usually of coefficient 0) in order to obtain an statistic and p-value. It first computes the skewness and kurtosis to quantify how far the distribution is from Gaussian in terms of asymmetry and shape. It then calculates how far each of these values differs from the value expected with a Gaussian distribution, and computes a single P value from the sum of these discrepancies. \n",
    "- Chi-square:  You can use a chi square test for normality. The advantage is that it's relatively easy to use, but it isn't a very strong test. If you have a small sample (under 20), it may be the only test you can use. For larger samples, you're much better off choosing another option.\n",
    "- Kolmogorov-Smirnov: Performs a test of goodness of fit, to determine if the data follows a normal distribution. It assumes, as H0, that the distribution obtained from the observed data is identical to the normal distribution. This is the least powerful offering the worst results off the three. It makes use of the properties of the cumulative probability distribution to compare any two distributions, in this case your samples, and a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Also there are very simple ways for normality test: \n",
    "    - Boxplots: Draw a boxplot of your data. If your data comes from a normal distribution, the box will be symmetrical with the mean and median in the center. If the data meets the assumption of normality, there should also be few outliers.\n",
    "    ![image.png](http://www.statisticshowto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/normal-boxplot-2.png)\n",
    "    - Q-Q Plots (Quantile-Quantile plots): is a scatterplot created by plotting two sets of quantiles against one another. If both sets of quantiles came from the same distribution, we should see the points forming a line that’s roughly straight. Here’s an example of a Normal Q-Q plot when both sets of quantiles truly come from Normal distributions.\n",
    "      ![image.png](https://data.library.virginia.edu/files/randu.jpeg)\n",

    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "*A common misconception: Majority (if not all) tests that rely on normality. Your target does not need to follow normal distribution. Only the residuals (difference between observed and predicted values) need to follow a Gaussian distribution to validate the hypothesis tests. "

    "\n",
    "It is a bivariate analysis that measures the strength of association between two variables and the direction of the relationship. \n",
    "\n",
    "For continuous variables:\n",
    "- Pearson r correlation: It is the most widely used correlation statistic to measure the degree of the relationship between linearly related variables.  For example, in the stock market, if we want to measure how two stocks are related to each other, Pearson r correlation is used to measure the degree of relationship between the two. Both variables should be normally distributed as well as assumptions like linearity and homoscedasticity.  It can asnwers questions like: \n",
    "    - Is there a statistically significant relationship between age, as measured in years, and height, measured in inches?\n",
    "    - Is there a relationship between temperature, measured in degrees Fahrenheit, and ice cream sales, measured by income?\n",
    "- Spearman: Tests for the strength of the association between two ordinal variables (does not rely on the assumption of normally distributed data). Pearson benchmarks linear relationship, Spearman benchmarks monotonic relationship. If you want to explore your data it is best to compute both, since the relation between the Spearman (S) and Pearson (P) correlations will give some information. Briefly, S is computed on ranks and so depicts monotonic relationships while P is on true values and depicts linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

Therefore, this coefficient is more appropriate for discrete data.\n",

    "    - Alternative Hypothesis: The two categorical variables are dependent.\n",

The modification is to the degrees of freedom used in the test, which tends to increase the test power for samples with unequal variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- F-test: F-distribution is the distribution of ratios of two independent estimators of the population variances. The main use of F-distribution is to test whether two independent samples have been drawn for the normal populations with the same variance, or if two independent estimates of the population variance are homogeneous or not, since it is often desirable to compare two variances rather than two averages."

    "    - One-Way : When we compare more than two groups, based on one factor (independent variable), this is called one way ANOVA. For example, it is used if a manufacturing company wants to compare the productivity of three or more employees based on working hours. This is called one way ANOVA.\n",
    "    - Two-Way : When a company wants to compare the employee productivity based on two factors (2 independent variables), then it said to be two way (Factorial) ANOVA.

    "    \n",
    "- Bonferroni: Once evidence of the existence of significant differences between the means of the algorithms is achieved, thanks to the variance analysis of ANOVA, it is possible to proceed with the POST-HOC test of Bonferroni in order to determine the discrepancies between all the samples, comparing the means of all the algorithms. Each p-value associated with the hypothesis  Hi  is compared taking an  α  adjusted to all the comparisons:  pi<αm , where  K  is the number of algorithms and m is the number of comparisons:  m=K∗(K−1)2"

    "- Anderson–Darling test: The test is a modification of the Kolmogorov- Smirnov test kstest for the null hypothesis that a sample is drawn from a population that follows a particular distribution. For the Anderson-Darling test, the critical values depend on which distribution is being tested against. This function works for normal, exponential, logistic, or Gumbel (Extreme Value Type I) distributions.\n",
